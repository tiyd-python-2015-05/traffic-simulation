Initial plans/layout:

For each car: get speed/location, and get speed/location of car in front of it.
If distance of car in front of it > car's current speed and if current car speed < 120 km/hr:
    speed up 2 m/s
If distance of car in front of it < car's current speed, slow car down to equal distance to next car

For each car every second get a random number between 0 and 1. If number is <= .10, slow car down 2 m/s
in addition to above steps

Create 1000 positions for every meter on track. Use linspace to do this, evenly spaced, and numbered.
Pass in value to initialize each car.

Measure car length from same place every time (front of car) (account for this when checking distance
to next car

Give cars numbers to track where they are in line to help prevent passing
